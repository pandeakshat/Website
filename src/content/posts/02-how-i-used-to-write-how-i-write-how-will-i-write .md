## How I used to write, How I write, How will I write.

Disclaimer : I am not a professional writer, I am on a journey to present my thoughts in a more sensible and accurate way, its a collection of my history, my present, and what I think I need to work on for my future.

Greetings,

I have been writing for quite a while, if we take out the academic requirements, I love presenting my thoughts through text or even hand written letters, the seemingly reference gap that it provides helped me streamline my thoughts for the longest time and also be able to connect it in a way that is difficult to explain.

The quality and skill developed over time as being part of an Asian family where being outspoken usually leads to troubles in the short and long run, being quiet and observant usually leads to better results statistically. However, being social animals, we need our own way to communicate as thoughts according to me slowly fill up and have limit space to exist, if thoughts are kept trapped and continuously added on with more thoughts, the entire process can become overwhelming, toxic, and lead to mental degradation over time.

This was my first lesson, learn to communicate and express.

My journey into writing started off in a similar manner. To be honest, my first few spurs into writing were not good in any form, broken grammar with repetition of sentences to form thought process and share them, in the beginning, with myself. Even my first poem was with a simple rhyming scheme with repeating lines like a chorus of a song that was not well made.

In my experience, my writing was at a standstill while the recipient was just myself. As I can understand my thoughts as I write them, so if I am the only person who is reading, the quality of the words are only as much as they require to be for me, the recipient to understand. As such, it came to a standstill. That was my second lesson, get an audience.

My first proper audience in a way, was my first girlfriend. I still have no idea how I got her as it was through online, with a girl who was in Australia and so close to a fairy, to me, someone mediocre at best at that time. I think I got lucky with the fact that our only medium of communication was English, and as such, I had an audience that required me to level up my way of communication for her to understand, the broken grammar with repetition wasn't enough as my thoughts were clear to me, it wasn't the same for my girlfriend(at that time). This was my third lesson, structure is important.

The other lessons for me over time were simple, choose your language structure based on your audience, understand concepts such as explain like i am five, and also understand sometimes including a bit of metaphor and challenge to your communication can lead to more intrigue and attention rather than simple sentences. People like unravelling and solving things, include puzzles to be solved, include biased comprehension, this can even help to understand how a person thinks sometimes. Understand manipulation techniques and laws of power to structure in a way its beneficial to you and still be honest and be able to understand the power of your words.

I used to write, simply, a jagged road between my thoughts to the screen in front, I do love handwriting also and am kinda proud that its acceptable. But with my background in computer science and programming, I got used to presenting my thoughts in a similar speed and manner with a keyboard. Most of my writing is in spurs, its not well thought and planned, its just sitting down and thinking in my own mind and then suddenly typing it out as my brain slowly bridges the gap between words to reach somewhere, to get to some consensus over time.

Life will keep on changing and I will learn more and more, I want to learn how to write for different occassions, to write whenever its required, and to write from my perspective showcasing only my life but also write based on someone else's experiences and make it about them, so it feels like they wrote it too. I will learn, and grow.

Keep me company, feedback and criticise and suggest where I could work on and what I could improve. Thank you.
